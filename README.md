# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This repository contains Python code implementing two gradient descent algorithms, Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent, to find the linear regression equation for a given dataset. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Overview

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predictive modeling and data analysis. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the error between predicted and actual values by adjusting model parameters iteratively.

This repository provides implementations of both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms for linear regression. The code iteratively updates the model weights to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual values.
